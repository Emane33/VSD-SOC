# CMOS Switching threshold and dynamic simulations

- we compared between two cmos one where widths for nmos and pmos are the same and the other cmos is not, we used Static behavior evaluation of a CMOS inverter analysis

- first what do we mean exactly by robustness?


In the context of a CMOS inverter, robustness refers to the ability of the inverter to perform reliably under various conditions and disturbances.

- we started with Switching Threshold which is  The input voltage at which the output voltage is exactly halfway between the high and low logic levels.
This threshold is crucial for ensuring reliable switching, and also Id is the same value for both nmos and pmos but with different directions, becuz both in saturation:

# Lab

- new mosfet with different widths for nmos and pmos:

- transistor analysis, where it starts from 0 to 1.8, shift is 0, rise time is 0.1ns , puls of 2ns and total period time of 4ns:

- falling and rising delay is around 0.9 in, first square for rising and the second for falling:
