# DC and Timing Analysis

- what is pvt?

Integrated circuits are designed in such a way that they can function 
in a wide variety of temperatures and voltages, rather than a single 
temperature and voltage.

- pvt:
  
- process:  There are millions of transistors on the single-chip as we are 
going to lower nodes and all the transistors in a chip cannot have the 
same properties. Process variation is the deviation in parameters of 
the transistor during the fabrication.

- temp: When a chip is operating, the temperature can vary 
throughout the chip. This is due to the power dissipation in the MOStransistors.

- voltage:  As we are going to the lower nodes the supply voltage for a 
chip is also going to less. Letâ€™s say the chip is operating at 1.2V. So, 
there are chances that at certain instances of time this voltage may 
vary.
