# CMOS power supply and device variation robustness evaluation

- we decreased the power supply in cmos which is represented in this chart:

- we noticed that the gain which is the change in output voltage over change in input voltage, is higher in 0.5v supply with 56% diffrence with 2.5v.

- also there is a 96% energy reduction from 2.5 to 0.5.

- however the falling and rising delays are high in 0.5 which make it slower.

  # Lab:-

  - as you can see we made the decreasing condition at the bottom:
