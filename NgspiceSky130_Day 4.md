# CMOS Noise Margin robustness evaluation



- we made this graph as a represent of states of inverter, where the closest are 1 and others are zero which are NML, but what is in between is undifined:

- we have made wave represent for noise margin:

- also the previous condition for vm were used to calculate NML and NMH, we see that for NML ir decrease due to the increase of NMH as pmos charges the capacitance, the NMH region increase means we have better ability to get 1
- so less of undifined, we can use it for digital design while undifined for analog design:
