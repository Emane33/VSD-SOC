# Introduction to logic synthesis

- what is logic synthesis?
 process where a high-level description of a circuit (usually written in a hardware description language like Verilog) is transformed into a gate-level representation.
 This gate-level representation consists of logic gates and flip-flops that can be physically implemented on a chip.

- synthesis EDA tool from synopsys understands .db instead of .lib.
- design information can be stored in .ddc format.
- what is SDC?
  
design intent in terms of power, timing and area constraints, it is based on TLC.

- what is target library?

standard cell database( binary) contains area, pins, timing and data( synthesis decesions).
