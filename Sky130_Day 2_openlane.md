# Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

- we can see the floorplan variables with their defaults in floorplan.tcl in configuration folder for OpenLane:

- in picorv32a the variables of OpenLane are sets in its configration file:

- before run floorplan, we check the config article by checking latest file generate it:

- to check core util are the same( in yellow) also metal layers are in green, there is alwyas +1 layer in floorplan defualt so the original in picorv32a congif.tcl:

- to run floorplan we change run_synthesis to run_floorplan( just show these parts becuz the rest is for placement which we will see later):

- content of floorplan def:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb70e399-86ad-4041-8902-0a1cbd91df36)

- as we see die width is 731615-0 while height is 742335-0, if we divide them by 1000 we get their siezes in microns

- area of die in microns is  731.615 âˆ— 742.335 = 543,103.421 square microns

- command to run floorplan in magic:

- port layer setting through config.tcl:

- now we use run_placement command
