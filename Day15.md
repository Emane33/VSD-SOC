# OpenRoad Physical Design

- what is opendroad?
  OpenROAD is an open-source software tool designed for semiconductor digital design, enabling a fully automated flow from RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Data System II) in less than 24 hours.
  It aims to reduce costs and complexity in hardware design, making it accessible for both research and commercial applications.
